      <p>I'm glad to have found a dentist that provides such good service, particularly after much less favourable experiences with other practices in North Leeds. Waiting times for routine appontments may take a little longer than I'd like, but emergency appontments are possible and there's even adequate parking nearby.</p>

      <p>Really happy with the service High Ash Dental Surgery. Staff are very friendly and professional. Receptionist is really nice and welcoming. The new Dental Hygienist is fantastic. Explained what was going to be done from start to finish and there was definitely visible patient care demonstrated. Just waiting for the books to open up again so i can get by family registered at this Surgery. Thanks</p>

      <p>Two days ago I had the roots from a molar removed, which I was dreading, and i couldn't believe how quick and painless the whole procedure was. My dentist had removed the molar which had broken but the dentist couldn't get the roots out. I was referred to High Ash to see the dental surgeon and I was very impressed and now I am pain free. I can't thank you enough.</p>
