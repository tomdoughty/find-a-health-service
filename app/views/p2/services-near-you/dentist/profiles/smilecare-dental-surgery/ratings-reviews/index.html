      <p>I booked emergency appointment for wobbly front celamic crown. Male dentist charged me £ 60 for procedure like cement. Last August he charged me £65 for same cement because I don't come regularly tbat is what he said. Breakdown is £15 for emergency fee and £45 for cement. I was registered as NHS patient, therefore it should be £22.70 charged for this emergency simple treatment. Then cement lasted only 2 and half weeks. It started wobbly again. I didn't want to pay emergency fee £15 so I made an appointment in about 2 weeks time. However crown was almost fall off, so I went for emergency. He try to charge me another £ 60 and also he told me he wouldn't treat me unless book next treatment such as implant or bridge. He offered only private treatment for bridge even NHS covers bridge. I had inlay on back teeth by same dentist at same clinic about 7 years ago. I knew his skill is not good and i had to go back for gliding inlay as I couldn't chew properly and damage inside of mouth. There is no intention to have implant even bridge. They will destroy your teeth and rip you off charging you private price without telling you even you are NHS patient. It is very dishonest and unprofessional. I found local dentist Brecknock Dental clinic where gave me proper cement and charged me £30 emergency Saturday private treatment. I will never go back Smilecare dental surgery on Junction road in my life.</p>

      <p>This dentist provides one of the worst customer experiences you can imagine. They treat their patients with utter disdain. Every time you have an appointment, expect to wait at least an hour. The last time I went, I waited an hour and a half and they sent up a patient who had an appointment after me. When I said that my appointment was first and that I had already waited an hour, the receptionist and dentist both said that I would just have to wait. It is hard to believe that a practice in central London can't even see patients in the order in which their appointments are booked, but this is the case here. Do not go. Find another practice that understands basic customer service and has a modicum of courtesy.</p>
