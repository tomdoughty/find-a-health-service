      <p>My dentist is always professional and polite. Her work is fantastic. I was reluctant to have a white filling due to previous poor experiences, but the filling she did for me was excellent. I haven't had any problems with it and it's been two years now. All the other ones only lasted 6 months. She always offers fantastic advice and is extremely knowledgeable. I recommend this dentist and this practice.</p>

      <p> I've been with this practice about 10 years. I'm disabled and everything is ground floor. The only issue is this weird dip just inside the door, so I leave my scooter outside. There is a roomy disabled toilet and the staff are helpful and considerate of my extra needs. I'm quite an anxious patient but my female dentist is very calm and understanding. She books appointments for me with extra time so I can take a short break if I get stressed. I would definitely recommend using this practice for NHS and private patients.</p>

      <p>I am very impressed by the services received by my dentist. She is always happy, smiling and friendly. She gives all of the relevant information needed to help you make your treatment decisions and she always helps you pick the right treatment for you.</p>
      <p>Great patient care & attitude, it makes the experience of going to the dentist actually pleasant.</p>
      <p> Sadly after moving away I will likely need to find a new surgery which is such a shame!</p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>

      <p>HDC have been my dentists for over 20yrs and I have been very happy to this date with their services, care and treatment with regards to looking after my teeth and allowing me to smile as I do. The same dentist has been treating me for the last few years and their work I can highly commend. I am eternally grateful to have them as my dentist. Keep up the good work everyone. Thank you so much.</p>
