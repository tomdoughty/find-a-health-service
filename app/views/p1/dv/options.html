      <p>Diarrhoea and vomiting are common in adults, children and babies. They're often caused by a stomach bug and should stop in a few days.</p>

        <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
          <p>You can usually treat yourself or your child at home. The most important thing is to have lots of fluids to avoid dehydration.</p>
          <h3>Do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>stay at home and get plenty of rest</li>
            <li>drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash – take small sips if you feel sick</li>
            <li>carry on breast or bottle feeding your baby – if they're being sick, try giving small feeds more often than usual</li>
            <li>give babies on formula or solid foods small sips of water between feeds</li>
            <li>eat when you feel able to – you don't need to eat or avoid any specific foods</li>
            <li>take <a href="#">paracetamol</a> if you're in discomfort – check the leaflet before giving it to your child</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Don't</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>do not have fruit juice or fizzy drinks – they can make diarrhoea worse</li>
            <li>do not make baby formula weaker – use it at its usual strength</li>
            <li>do not give children under 12 medicine to stop diarrhoea</li>
            <li>do not give aspirin to children under 16</li>
